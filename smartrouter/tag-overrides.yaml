# Purpose: Tag overrides are for reliably rebuilding the image per the state of
#          the branch at the time the tag was created, along with other modules
#          at reliable and unchanging reference points. Useful for CVE respins.
#          Warning: Only reliable if referenced via a tag itself!
#   Usage: cekit build --overrides-file tag-overrides.yaml
