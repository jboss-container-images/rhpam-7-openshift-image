# Purpose: Artifact overrides are for replacing "non-plain" artifacts with
#          "plain" artifacts. Useful, for example, when referenced modules have
#          not updated from "path" to "name". See "Artifact types" here:
#          https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/descriptor/module.html#artifact-types
#          Currently used for jenkins builds for continuous integration.
#   Usage: cekit build --overrides-file branch-overrides.yaml \
#                      --overrides-file artifact-overrides.yaml
